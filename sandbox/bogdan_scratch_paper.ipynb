You can un-clip and remove to use in-hand like for keys for example or an ID badge.\\n\\nIt is made of a thick 100% nylon material.  The print is good on the lanyard.\\n\\nI definitely recommend this lanyard.  It is an MLB licensed product.  It is only the lanyard as pictured.

It fill the magazine all the way and didn't leak seemed like a tight seal around the threading of the propane and adapter. It happens fairly quick so don't try to force tighten it any past that. It doesn't have a reservoir to add the silicone to, but specifically states in the directions to put the silicone in the nozzle of the propane canister before screwing on the adapter.

       "  'reviewText': \"We have a Pocket Rocket that we use for backpacking. We got tired of unpacking it to use in our travel trailer, and having to remember to put it back for the next backpacking trip. We were going to buy a second Pocket Rocket for the camper, and noticed this stove was less expensive. It works just as well as the Pocket Rocket, and the larger burner works better with a larger pan, such as a small skillet. The pan sits level and is more stable than on the small Pocket Rocket burner. It disassembles easily for storage in its zippered fabric pouch. In fact, it's easier to get this stove out of the pouch than to get the Pocket Rocket out of its tight plastic container.\\n\\nI gave it four and not five stars because its larger burner uses more fuel. Even turned down all the way, it's more of a slow boil than a simmer. Cooking 2 meals and 2 hot drinks a day, we used up a canister in 3 days instead of 5. We usually finish the last few minutes of cooking by putting the pan in a pot cozy and letting it finish up on its own heat. With the cost of gas canisters, that's more important than ever.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"This lightweight burner is awesome! I especially love the carrying case it came with. From previous backpacking trips we have used the Etekcity Ultralight Portable Outdoor Backpacking Camping Stoves with Piezo Ignition - this lightweight stove works well and has never failed us; the only draw back is that the circumference of the stove is really small. It is difficult to balance even a small cooking pot over the Etekcity stove. We would have to hang on to the pot's handles while we boil water. So! I decided to try this burner out and see if it'll be able to balance our pots for boiling water. It definitely did a better job balancing the pot than the Etekcity stove. My friend still has his Etekcity stove, and now I have this stove and both works really well.\\n\\nThis burner does not have a starter like the Etekcity stove, but the starter on our Etekcity stove stopped working after a handful of uses under some light rain. If you're trying to make a decision on what stove to buy, I personally wouldn't list the self starter feature of the Etekcity stove as a pro. You'd have to carry a lighter or matches anyways (we do for emergencies and bonfires) so this feature is not necessary.\\n\\nUPDATE: I took this stove at high elevation (14,000 ft) and worked just fine. I had to fashion a wind shield from foil to boil he water faster, but other than that this small but mighty stove worked beyond initial expectations.\",\n",

If you ride when it's colder than the upper 30's, I'd say you'd need a heavier glove, as I wore them once in the upper 30's with some wind, and my hands were on the verge of getting cold.\\n\\nThey're made well, and designed well, so that no seams or other protuberances get in the way between your hands and the hoods/bars- and they're easy to get on and off.  All in all, a good product that does what it was designed to do.\",\n",

Well, I usually wear L so I bought XL.  I should've ordered L because the XL will fit over my normal gloves.  My hands slip around inside the gloves when riding and this can be very uncomfortable.  Which leads to my next point:  these gloves did not feel any warmer than my original gloves which are not warm-weather gloves.  And these gloves do not have pads, so if you are the type of rider who likes padding then stay away.  I ride 40+ miles (road) every time and I need pads because my hands start to go numb after awhile if I don't have them.  They seem well made, and Pearl Izumi is a quality brand.  I'm sure if I had ordered L instead then maybe some of these issues wouldn't exist.\\nOverall, these are quality made gloves and I'm sure will work well for 60 degree weather.\",\n",

They are well-made, and have enough material to allow for some overlap between the glove and a long-sleeved jersey/coat.  The rubberized material on the fingers and palm work well for gripping the handlebars.\\n\\nWhile they are well-made, they are not gloves for really cold days.  A really good pair of gloves won\\'t make your hands too hot and sweaty when riding.  As a result, my hands started out slightly chilly, but as I worked my hands get warm in these gloves.  This is true (for me, at least) from about 40 degrees and up.  Under 40 degrees, I found that wearing a pair of fingerless summer cycling gloves on top worked well to keep my hands warm until the low 30\\'s.  I\\'m guessing a thin wool liner glove would also work really well to extend the temperature range. In any event, over about 40 degrees my hands were reasonably warm after about 10 minutes of riding, without being sweaty or clammy.  Also, a good pair of gloves for colder temps are windproof, which these are, generally--in really windy conditions, you might feel a slight amount of wind.\\n\\nIn all, these are great for a certain range of temperatures, but for really cold weather, another type of glove is needed.\\n\\nUPDATE on 12/23/12: Retract the \"well-made\" from this review (and, as a result, one star--meaning these gloves go from four to three stars overall).  After washing it per manufacturer\\'s directions, the seam at the base of the thumb started to unravel.  Rather than try to return them, I\\'ll planning on re-sewing the seam myself.  However, I was expecting them to last a bit longer than a month.',\n",

I've read a couple of reviews about these gloves, and the biggest complaint, for bicyclers, is the lack of palm padding. They are right, these Pearl Izumi Thermal Gloves don't have any padding. If you're used to cycling with padded gloves, you have to get used to moving your hands around quite a bit with these to keep the pressure off your palms. I use them mainly while riding on a paved road, and the lack of padding is not too big of an issue. I'd much rather ride without some padding than ride with cold hands.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"This watch was priced so reasonably compared to similar products... so much so that I wasn't sure what the quality would be like (especially after reading some of the negative reviews). No worries, it's great! I am an outdoor enthusiast - love camping, hiking, jogging, etc. and this watch is so useful. It makes jogging laps so much more interesting in that it helps you keep up with the number of laps executed, what your average lap was and what your fastest lap was. It makes it so easy to set goals or try to beat your best time. I also love hiking in the mountains and can't wait to use the compass and altimeter functions. The temperature and barometer features have been pretty spot on as well (knowing that since the temperature sensor is on the underside, you need to take the watch off for an accurate reading). And, on top of all these great features, it really is a nice watch as well! Love it! I have, to date, not had some of the issues that other reviewers have complained about. It may seem a little complicated at first but it is a lot of information and the manual I downloaded from the Pyle site made it very manageable. The alarm function also works fine and, despite what another reviewer wrote, you can choose AM vs. PM. You truly are getting a lot of watch for the money! Should it fall apart on me anytime soon or malfunction, I'll be happy to amend my review. Until that time, I highly recommend this watch and plan on buying one for my brother for his birthday!\",\n",

You very quickly get accustomed to quality metal knives like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Kershaw-Rainbow-Leek/dp/B0009VCA08/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Kershaw Rainbow Leek</a>&nbsp;and you start judging all knives by the same high standards.\\n\\nWell guess what, this Gerber isn\\'t really up to par. First, its rather large handle is plastic. Not cheap nasty plastic like a Spyderco I also ordered, but plastic nonetheless. It feels sturdy enough, but after all-metal knives, it just doesn\\'t feel right. The connection between handle and blade is clearly overengineered: instead of just a liner lock, you get a liner lock PLUS a stopping mechanism that you need to press. What is this for? Is the knife likely to close on itself if I don\\'t set it? If so, this is a TERRIBLE design decision because this takes far too long to open the knife and get it \\'ready\\'.\\n\\nSpeaking of opening: this knife is fairly annoying in this regard. To open it, you basically have to push the blade on the protruding pin with your finger. It CAN be done with one hand, but it\\'s not very convenient. Also, even after you do it, you have to remember to set the \\'protector switch\\' which, as I said, is quite a pain.\\n\\nThe interesting thing about the knife is that even though the back edge is coated and not sharpened, I clearly see that the knife was made to be sharpened on the back edge, effectively making it double-edged. So I did exactly that. By the way, factory sharpening of this knife is just terrible, so uneven and unprofessional it makes me wonder why they even bother.\\n\\nOverall I\\'d say this is an OK purchase, the only concerns I have is the plasticky grip as well as the fact that the knife is rather big.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"7/29/15\\nI received this knife a a little over three weeks ago and the shipping was great as is to be expected with Amazon.\\nNow about the knife:\\nFirst ill start off with how it looks, if you think it looks sexy in the picture wait until you hold it in your hands it sure is pretty the pivot, screws and thumb studs give it a nice contrast.\\nThis knife is a great medium sized EDC folding knife, the liner lock feels sturdy and even without the roto-lock doesn't feel like its going to close in my hand the action is extremely smooth but crisp it doesn't feel flimsy or cheap the extra lock does add a little extra peace of mind for those who are paranoid or who have had knives close on them.\\nThe handle material feels really good in the hand and is grippy enough for wet hands(yes i wet my hands to test it), i like that the thumb studs rest against the liner when open giving it really good rigidity. Now addressing some of the complaints I saw about the amount of side play of the blade, ANY folding or deployable knife WILL have some side play to it its an inherent part of its design when you fist get it out of the box though its play is negligible. However the play in the blade will be noticeable if you've had it a long time or  you're applying side pressure(prying) things purposefully which folding knives are not meant for. Side play due to regular use is usually due to loosening of the pivot screw which can be fixed easily by tightening the pivot screw. Some have complained about the clip.  The clip is nice and sturdy and can be flipped for lefties as well which is neat. I honestly see no fault in it, it fits flush on the pocket and it grabs on tight i have not felt it was going to fall out of my pocket at any point. Another really great thing is the false edge can actually be sharpened depending on where you live though that may or may not be illegal always check first and take it to a professional sharpener unless you are either really good or want to ruin your top (false)edge and no it won't cut you when its closed if you sharpen the top edge it fits entirely inside the handle. Overall this is a very nice little knife and with a lifetime warranty from Gerber, its a no brainer. But beware if you're thinking of buying either the automatic or assisted version of this knife, both the assisted and automatic versions of this knife are made in Taiwan and are not as well made so take that into account if you're thinking of getting those versions.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'I bought my Applegate Covert about 8 years ago and it is still a great knife.  You see, I am a casual when it comes to knives and bought this one based on my buddy\\'s praise for it and it\\'s unique look.  Now in retrospect I can say it has been a fantastic knife that was worth the high price I paid back then.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\nSince I use my knives for various utility purposes I prefer a combination blade, and I think this style is executed well on the covert.  The plain edge is great for piercing, slicing, shaving, and carving tasks, while the serrations are great for hard cutting and sawing jobs.  I also really like the style of the serrations on this blade, as they are subtle but useful.  The 154CM steel is up to the task and requires only occasional sharpening, as I do not use the knife as a daily workhorse. I find the FRN scales on this knife to be of a very good quality and feel, and the overall fit and finish of the knife was fantastic out of the box.\\n\\nWhere this knife really shines is in the outdoors.  I bring this blade as my main cutting tool on camping and hiking trips.  The combination blade is useful for everything from cutting rope to spearing the last chunk of beef from the dinty-moore stew can.  The spear point also makes a viable substitute for some philips head screws and you can lay it down to turn slotted screws.  Where we hike, self-defense isn\\'t a major issue, but with the balance, high quality-swivel and cruel point of this knife I could strike and make it count if I had to.\\n\\nSome list the secondary lock as a drawback of this blade but I think its great.  It allowed the liner lock to be design thinner and therefore easier to disengage with one hand.  Then with the rolling lock engaged the knife feels extremly secure and it really inspires confidence in harder cutting tasks. The rolling lock does annoy some people, but let\\'s be honest, it is effortless to engage and disengage.\\n\\nFinally, as I mentioned before I don\\'t have a strong need to use this knife in self-defense but it WAS designed as a tactical blade.  Somewhat uniquely, it features the spear-shaped double bevel blade.  I have no need to sharpen the upper bevel but it could be done in theory.  VERY interesting as another reviewer pionted out is that with the false edge sharpened it is also completely concealed with the knife closed.  This makes it viable (if not somewhat disconcerting) to carry this way.  I\\'m not an expert but dual edges would appear to provide a clear tactical advantage should the need arise.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\nI only have a couple minor complaints about the knife, and they really only apply when attempting to use this knife for EDC (as I once did).  First it is a very long, straight design.  With blade almost 4\" long and a closed length of almost 5\" it is, in my opinion, too long for the pocket of my jeans.  Particularly when you factor in the sub-par pocket clip, which requires some bending to tighten (mine was too loose out of the box).  The straighness of the knife means it pokes straight down to the bottom of your pocket and wants to push up when you sit down.  Finally, I have learned from experience that the length and menacing look of this blade will alarm some folks when you break it out in the middle of a public place to nip a hangnail.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'The knife arrived today,I will start with what I already own and why I wanted it. I have several knifes in my collection and several that I use daily for EDC. I keep one in a drop bag and another for when I hike and head into the bush and need something reliable, strong and of very good quality. I have a cold steel Recon 1 which I use as a back up knife cutting blade and weapon if needed. Most of my knifes are made by Al Mar, Spyderco, Cold Steel. I have researched extensively and all have been used in the field. Al Mar and Spyderco in my opionion are quality with excellent materials and beautiful designs at very competitive prices. Cold steel, are totally reliable and the tri add lock is like a bank vault when it snaps open with good materials and its dependable, very dependable. Now we get to the \"Gerber covert Applegate\". I have had the knife around 5 hours now at the point of writing this review. I unpacked it and was immediatly under whelmed. This knife cost almost the same as my Spyderco Manix 2 and was more expensive than my Rat 1 and Spyderco tenacious. The blade is loose and wobbles from side to side, it also wobbles up and down even with the lock applied, the action feels rough I attempted to tighten it after oiling it with some thin gun oil but this had no effect. The blade steel is suitable for my cutting needs but it feels cheap I mean really cheap,the coating on the blade looked like its been painted with a brush. I hate slagging off a knife as i don\\'t design them or have the skills to make them but i do use them and know whats good and whats not. I have only ever slagged off a knife once before and normally keep my opions to myself but I have to say it. If you want a knife for stabbing and cutting or as a back up weapon do not buy this knife. Buy a cold steel \"Ti Lite\" its stronger by miles and considerable better quality. I have one and was hoping this would replace it, this Gerber Applegate won\\'t... right now its already in my junk draw and will stay there. I read several reviews about this knife in one evening but clearly not enough research was completed and i have made a costly error. I believed the titanium coated black blade designed and made by a professional solider would be a quality knife,  The Covert is not good enough to rely on in combat not in my opinion not by a country mile. I have been in combat and I would have thrown this knife away and picked up a rock rather than carry it. In short if you want a folding knife for stabbing buy the cold steel Recon or the Spyderco Paramilitary 2 they are strong and the blades are needle sharp and are considerably better quality and better value. Of course this is my opinion and not based on price alone but Cold steel and spyderco live by there reputation. I was a professional solider for 14 years and been in law enforcement for 9. I have used a knife a knife for what the Gerber Aplegate was designed for. you don\\'t want a knife failing on you when your this close to your enemy because if our knife fails you can garantee if hes a professional his knife won\\'t be a Gerber Aplegate and you will be in the s*** wishing you had that rock I told you about. I carry a Spyderco Military off duty and a Cold Steel Recon 1 on duty and when in the bush I carry a fixed blade along with my Military. A good point of research with I find useful and entertaining is nutnfancy on \"Utube\". I hope this is of some help to someone. Regards John.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I have carried my Gerber Applegate Covert folder every day for over two years now and I can't say enough good things about it. The finish has held up extremely well and the edge stays sharp for a long time in between sharpenings. With the liner lock and roto-lock, it's as solid and confidence-inspiring as a fixed blade knife, without the bulk of being a fixed blade knife. I am left handed, and the reversible pocket clip is a very nice (and often hard to find in other knives) feature. The screws that hold the clip on are Torx screws, not hex/Allen screws, so be aware if  you move your clip from one side to the other so you don't mess up the screw heads with the wrong tool. As for the length, it's perfect for carrying in my back pocket when closed, and long enough to be very useful when open but not too long as to be clumsy. The jimping on the handle near the base of the blade and along the spine of the blade helps with gripping the knife, I rarely feel as if my hand might slip forward when using it. The shape of the blade gives it a bit of intimidation factor if you ever had to rely on it for self defense. I keep a paracord loop tied into the hole in the handle to loop around my wrist when using the knife in situations where I might drop it, something particularly useful in situations where you're working on a ladder, in a tight area, or for self defense.\",\n",

As a marksmanship instructor I really like using this during a class as both a training aide as well as a designated cleaning surface during our \"handgun maintenance\" portion of the class.\\n\\nThe mats are generally the size of a dinner table placemat, large enough to provide sufficient amount of place for disassembling and cleaning a handgun, but not to large to become bulky when rolled up to be stored away.\\n\\nThe writing and graphics imprinted on the front side are legible and easily seen, while the backside is soft and non marring (perfect to keep the wife happy when I\\'m disassembling a gun on her kitchen table). The top (printed) side is cushioned and protects the finish of your handgun while also being able to absorb those few drops of solvent that inevitably end up dripping off the gun.\\n\\nMy students like them because as we discuss parts, they can easily follow along on the mat, seeing an almost life size explode view/representation right in front of them. The mats are clearly labeled making it a snap to easily identify parts. And surprisingly, even though the mat is black, handgun parts can easily be seen on it - Thus far no left over parts after reassembling dozens of handguns:-)\\n\\nThey are available in most of the popular hand gun models and although possibly a bit pricey - I still feel well worth the cost. I\\'m very satisfied I made the investment.',\n",

So I saw this nike hat and gave it a shot. Right out of the box it fits perfectly (it's a one size hat with Adjustable Velcro strap in the back) its described as lightly structured online and that is a adequate description. It has some form to It but not so much that it looks like your wearing a big bulky hat, it's just perfect. True black color with nike swoosh on front and back. Made of thin material but I don't think it's as thin as some reviews describe it as. It's not as thick/hot as my black new era hat. Wicks sweat well and I will be wearing for a long time. I plan to order more.\",\n",

Not a negative vote by any means, but a realistic appreciation of this model.\\n\\nThis folder will serve me nicely enough in the role of that little secondary knife on hand, but it is not suited to work that I would even call \"light duty.\" It is an interesting novelty item, nicely enough made. The steel can be kept sharp enough (I disclose that I even go so far as to strop even this sort of blade regularly), and it is small enough to be a discrete companion. Should I need a small knife for any real work indoors or out-of-doors this isn\\'t the tool.\\n\\nWhile interesting, the opening, closing, and locking mechanism could actually unlock quite easily with any aggressive pushing motion on the back end of the blade. Provided one remembers that this attractive knife isn\\'t meant for such work, this will not be a problem.\\n\\nWas it worth the money? For the novelty of the mechanism and the attractive looks, perhaps. For a serious working knife in the shop, the field, the toolbox, or the first aid kit? No. CRKT offers a lot of knives that will serve in those roles nicely.',\n",

I finally used 600 and 800 grit paper on my belt sander and finished it with a leather stropping belt. It is now very sharp and the grind is even. The sheath came with the snaps not quit matching up--it was really tight to snap shut (had to pull with pliers). Since the back is leather I tried stretching it by forcing 2  1/4 in belts through the belt loop and let it sit for 2 weeks. It snaps a lot better now but still a little tight.

The 'nail puller' is a poor design, somewhere between a strap cutter and a nail puller but somehow really does neither.  It sould either be sharpened more to cut rope/straps or ground out into a v shape like a hammer claw.  The spike appears to be ground on all edges but is actually not, no sharp edges, just a point.  I actually like it better this way but the photos are misleading.  The good news?  It's a solid full tang, with perfect stock thickness and excellent cutting geometry that really chops well!  Not too thick, not too thin.  The handle is very comfortable, like a hard rubber, that absorbs shock, doesn't slip and should hold up very well.  It is the perfect length, a little heavy, but not enough to matter, better too solid than not solid enought! The sheath is marginal, but a little more sturdy than the average.  I would have preferred paying a few extra dollars and getting a good kydex botom eject scabbard.  But here's the good news, this hawk is a steal for this price!  Kershaw hit this one out of the park!  You could not duplicate it anywhere else on the market for less than $100.  I chopped the heck out of a good log with it too, no chipping and the sharp stayed that way.\",\n",

Came nicely sharpened and the sheath was far better than I expected, especially at the price point.  Love the heft and the rubberized grips.  Got this primarily as an emergency tool for the car.  I have no doubts about this tool's ability to breech a window or windshield, pry open a door, or cleave an occassional head if needed during a zombie outbreak.  Would have preferred carbon steel, but compared to the Colt Hawk, which IS carbon steel and is in the same ballpark, this one seems the more solid tool--thicker material, better attention to detail, and  WAAAAY better sheath.  The Colt Hawk makes a great throwing tool and is fast in the hand.  This one is a bit heavier to wield, but I have more confidence in its emergency functionality for use in vehicular situations, based on the thickness of the steel, heft of the blade, and general design.\\n\\nI also have a Kill Devil Sniper Hawk from Swamp Rat.  While this will not replace the KDSH in the line up, I also wouldn't want to throw the SR in the back of a car.  This one can take punishment and is priced so you won't be overly angry if something happens to it.  Considering a couple more--one for the other car, and another to throw with the kids in the back yard.  Worth the money and then some.  Thanks, Kershaw, for bringing this to market at a reasonable price.  Well done.\\n\\nEDIT TO ADD:  After owning and using for a year, it's still exceeding my expectations.  I've used it to chop and split hard mesquite logs for the smoker and other chores.  I've been in a hurry and chopped said mesquite on my driveway, missing a few times (or rather, glancing off into the driveway) and aside from a few minor dings, have had no issues.  To the poster that deducted a star for a scratch from shipping?  Maybe ding the seller, but seems off to downgrade the product for a seller's poor packaging (and yes, Amazon does a bad job packing these so I can understand why it might be problematic). To to reviewer that had his split first time out, I'd say yes, I think you got a lemon.  Hopefully you contacted Kershaw and allowed them to make it right.  I hate getting a lemon and it colors my perception of the companies from whom I receive them, but I've used the heck outta this thing and it still keeps going!\\n\\nI have a second one for the bugout bag and gave one to my sister and one to my dad.  No complaints from either to date.  Will probably someday buy a third one for fun ;)\",\n",

This has lead me to this umbrella the gustbuster classic just seeing that name you already know its going to be one awesome umbrella that will keep you dry in a storm!!\\n\\nFeatures at a Glance: In bullet list form.\\n\\nHandle 55+ MPH Wind\\nWind-Release Vent\\nStrong lightweight fiberglass ribs\\n\\nPros:\\nHandling 55+ MPH wind\\nEasy to open/close\\nLifetime warranty\\n\\nCons:\\nPrice\\n\\nThis is my first quality umbrella as for spending $30+ on it. I can say its differently worth spending on as for the first test I have use it out in 30+mph wind with a bit of light rain for about a hour in those condition this umbrella stand up to the test while other people around me with walmart quality umbrella had problem with the frame inverting inside out or the umbrella cover coming off. I let my friend hold the umbrella also an they were definitely impress with the quality. I will say Three people can fit into it with everyone staying fairly dry but I think two people would have been better suited for this size.\\n\\nI like the wooden handle design and material used that curves like a J shaped its been a while since I seen these type of umbrella as now days modern umbrella usually comes with a black plastic handles so it was a selling point for me seeing the J shaped handle + wooden material. I have fairly large hands as for me the handle fit comfortably and perfectly in my hands without feeling uncomfortable.\\nThe length of the umbrella is pretty long an I would not say its travel friendly unless its meant to be use for the walk from car to the store and back. I believe there is other options for a travel friendly compact umbrella because when this umbrella is close its still pretty long.\\n\\nIf you are looking for a umbrella to handle strong winds give coverage for 2 people from rain I would recommend this umbrella as its not too expensive compare to the other brands.\\nIf you are looking for a compact travel umbrella I don't recommend this as its too long an heavy for travel friendly.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'I bought a black Gustbuster umbrella in 2007. I still have that same umbrella now in 2016. That\\'s nine years. Imagine going nine years without losing an umbrella!\\n\\n QUALITY \\nWhile this umbrella has endured these past nine years, there are a couple of things from my experience that you should know about it. One, when you pop the umbrella opens there is a mechanism near the top that keeps it open. This mechanism works most of the time, but sometimes it doesn\\'t lock into place and your umbrella top goes bouncing up and down until it randomly locks into place. I hope they have fixed this in the nine years since I bought it. Second, the button that unlocks the umbrella, on the shaft right above the curved handle, wore down over time and broke off, affecting the structural stability of the fiberglass shaft slightly [see photos]. This means that the umbrella will open automatically when you un-Velcro it, and when you close it it takes a little effort to hold it in place while you put the two Velcro straps back on. Minus a star for these two issues, but these two things don\\'t affect the functionality of the umbrella, much.\\n\\nBesides those two mentioned points, the umbrella works fine, and its condition still looks like the day I got it. The fabric looks the same, no seams have come undone, it looks great. The wooden handle looks weathered but is still as strong as ever. The umbrella tip end has worn down over the years from being dragged on the ground, but that has no effect on its use.\\n\\n WIND RESISTANCE \\nGustbuster\\'s wind resistance was the primary reason I bought one. I saw their video testing this umbrella to 55+ mph winds and that impressed me. Their tear drop shaped vents and two layered top construction keeps wind resistance to a minimum. Wind blows and flows right through the holes. During a few extra windy days this umbrella did invert, and didn\\'t break apart. It reverted back to its normal shape like nothing ever happened. Like a boss.\\n\\n FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS \\nAs an Industrial Designer, here\\'s my two cents as to how to improve future models: One, fix the mechanism that keeps the top in place so it works at all times. Two, use better materials for the button and shaft that opens the umbrella up, or maybe use different mechanics. Three, maybe use a waterproof material for the fabric (website says it\\'s waterproof, but maybe they added that later since the time I bought it); that way it will add another selling point: being wind and water resistant.\\n\\n HOW NOT TO LOSE AN UMBRELLA \\nHonestly, I don\\'t know how I managed not to lose this umbrella this entire time. However, one of my tricks whenever I take this umbrella out was constantly thinking to myself, \"this is an expensive umbrella, don\\'t lose it!\", or, \"you\\'re carrying $40 around, don\\'t lose it!\" And thus, that\\'s how I prevent myself from forgetting about it. There were a few close calls of me nearly forgetting it somewhere, but this is still with me.\\n\\n WARRANTY \\nGustbuster offers a \"Limited Lifetime Warranty\". If something happens to your umbrella, you mail it back with a $10 check, and they will send you a new or repaired one. Considering it probably cost $10 to ship it back, the total will likely cost you $20. A new umbrella cost $40. Whether that\\'s worth it is up to you.\\n\\nThis is a quality umbrellawith the exception of the top portion that locks it in place when you close it, and the button on the shaft to open it. I will continue to use it, and should it eventually fall apart and be irreparable, then I\\'ll probably end up buying another Gustbuster to replace it. Recommended.\\n\\n*** NOTE ***\\nI noticed that this umbrella now has a lot of color options. Check Gustbuster\\'s website for the official colors available for each model. I have a feeling some of the colors are third party manufacturers and sellers trying to cash in on Gustbuster\\'s name. Buy it from Amazon as the seller, or from a reputable source.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'I\\'ve read a ton of reviews before buying. I made up my mind to buy either a Procella or Gustbuster 48\" or 62\" with leaning towards the 62\". Either brand would have been cool with me. Gustbuster was part of the Black Friday deals so I bought it. I\\'ve had a couple of opportunities to use and also went back to read some comments of other reviews before deciding to provide my 2 cents. So here goes...\\n\\nFirst, this is not huge although it is pretty big folded up. I\\'d say it is great for one adult male. I tried using this with my second grader and it was a bit tight for us. I\\'m big but my kid isn\\'t. I believe 52 inches would have worked better for us, but we weren\\'t walking huddled up close together. The 48\" will probably work if 2 middle sized people are walking huddled close, so if that is the intent this is perfect. Otherwise, go a little bigger - 52\"-62\".\\n\\nThis is sturdy and stood up to pretty strong winds on its first use and at times it did feel more like a parachute than an umbrella, so it held up to strong winds. This part is pretty consistent to most reviewers.\\n\\nIn past, I\\'ve only purchased Totes compact umbrellas and they never provided adequate coverage and have turned inside out in strong winds, so the Gustbuster has been a step up in all facets.\\n\\nThe wood finish on the tip and handle may not last a very long time as some had written about - this is only an opinion. However, I\\'ve scraped it against the side of the house both on the handle and tip and it still looks new, but I\\'ll concede a few more times and it will start to show the wear. Still I believe the integrity of the umbrella is solid and will still hold up even if it has scrapes and scratches.\\n\\nOverall, this is a great umbrella, but my intention is to use it as a personal umbrella and not really for two so it fits my bill perfectly. This may not be true for others.',\n",

This thing has some weight to it and certainly feels like a quality umbrella. The shaft is sturdy and the canopy  is a thicker material than most other brands. I ordered this the day that my old umbrella turned inside-out during a storm. This GustBuster is, so far, living up to its name. I was caught in a storm today and learned that you have to be diligent and hold tight to the handle- when a wind grabs it it pulls hard but does not distort the canopy. (Contrary use for an umbrella, though. If it\\'s windy enough to turn your umbrella inside-out, then it\\'s windy enough to rain horizontal and no umbrella will keep you dry.)

I live in Florida where we get LOTS of rain many months of the year, so a decent umbrella is a must, even if, like me, you don\\'t waste your time and/or risk your life playing golf in a thunderstorm. 48 \" is just right, unless you\\'re a valet, a doorman or someone who likes to share his umbrella with others.  The construction is durable and sturdy - I have never had a wind \"blow it inside out\"-issue.  Folds and expands flawlessly and dries reasonably quickly after a good soaking. The hunter green is a great color. Comes with a two velcro ties and a sturdy sleeve when you want to keep it wrapped. The price is a steal.  Gene Kelly wouldn\\'t have sung or danced if he\\'d had this baby.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'This umbrella features a good combination of decent construction, wind resistance, and reasonable size. Its not perfect, but after owning one of these for several years while looking around at, and trying, some others, I think it is the best on the market (at least in this general price range).\\n\\nPros:\\n -- It is big enough to actually keep you dry without being unwieldy.  With anything bigger (like most true \"golf\" umbrellas) it becomes difficult to maneuver down a city sidewalk.\\n\\n -- The GustBuster technology really does work.  You can take it out in some pretty darn windy conditions and not have it flip or break on.  The entire canopy spreading structure is well made and reliable.\\n\\n-- Its handsome enough to carry around on a rainy day without making you look schlumpy.  Sure, it no piece of luxury craftsmanship, but you can easily take it out on the same day you\\'re wearing a good suit and not look like an idiot.\\n\\nCons:\\n -- Others have noted that the locking mechanism of the auto-opening feature stops working after a while.  So far, with my new umbrella, that has not been a problem; but it did happen with my previous one.  It never really stuck me as a major annoyance though; there are velcro closures on the canopy that you\\'re going to use anyway and they work fine to hold the umbrella closed.\\n\\n-- I wish the handle was real wood.  I can\\'t remember if it was on my old one or not.  That being said, it is not as if the current handle looks noticeably bad and I\\'ve not seen any indication that I should expect any of the chipping or flaking that some other reviewers have complained about.',\n",

(Survivalists call this a \"Get Home\" bag.)  This clever device is a perfect alternative to having a water bottle lay flat in the bottom of the bag, which I find cumbersome and annoying as it gives the bag a low center of gravity and causes it to bounce off my thigh as I walk.  Clipping the bottle to the top opening of the bag not only distributes the weight better, completely eliminating all the bouncing, but also opens up extra room for more of the items I\\'d like to have with me should I someday need them. I can also hang a water bottle off my belt when I am mowing the lawn.  Removing the bottle, taking a sip, and re-clipping the bottle can now be easily done with one hand, allowing me to keep the other on the mower (taking both hands off would shut the mower down).  Construction is very sturdy, so I know this will last (bottle holders with rubber collars tend to break on me rather quickly).  And the bottle is held securely, which in my experience no other product does.  Was so impressed with this item that, upon delivery, I immediately ordered another pair.',\n",

In this case, with the purple grip (the gun is a present for my wife, though purple is a nice color even for me).  The one that came with the gun is hard, dark colored, relative thin plastic.  The purple grip is molded over two hard plastic liners which are very similar to the parts I took off, from the back view at least.  The fit is excellent as you can see from the photos. I reused the existing Torx screws, reapplying some blue Loctite to the threads before refitting.\\nThe grip is now more rounded and feels great, with the finger grooves matching the natural position of the fingers.  I fitted the Pachmayr rubber grips on my LC9s and this is similar in feel.  However, the slip-on Pachmayr moves and feels loose in hot weather (I removed it in preference for adhesive grip tape)  This purple grip is solidly fixed and feels like original equipment.  The color brightens up the gun too.  I know my wife will love this carry pistol.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'I have a very good friend who teaches Zumba at a local gym.  One of the challenges that can come from being the mom of an amazing special needs kiddo is that I\\'m not able to catch her classes.  Out of curiosity some time last year, I tried a free Zumba video on-line and despite the fact that I do know some basic dance steps, I felt about as coordinated as a drunken duck.  I told her, you know, I think strength training is just my thing for now.  It\\'s what I need to focus on to be the best mom I can be to my son, and I just need cardio I don\\'t suck at right off the bat. She told me I just needed to try it again, and I said \"nah, I\\'m good.\"  But the problem is, I get bored quickly, and I switch out my cardio regularly because I think that\\'s a great thing to do from the fitness perspective.  So I\\'m trying it again because I\\'m experimenting with dance cardio right now.\\n\\nIt took me a few days to get through this video because my son was not into it.  And even when I could get him to be patient with it, he was doing things like rolling his spinning chair up behind me, or rolling the yoga ball into me.  So it was more of a workout then I expected just to get through it because I was dancing around and dodging obstacles.  And then there was the time he decided maybe if he came up and gave me a good, long squeeze hug I\\'d put on his Veggie Tales and turn off the Zumba.  He\\'s very determined, so it took me three days to get attempt to get through this for a preview of it.\\n\\nI think this was well done, definitely for beginners.  I think they do a great job of breaking down the explanations of what you need to be doing.  And I felt enlivened and just downright joyful after each section I was able to get through before my son hit combustion mode. And quite honestly, Beto\\'s presentation is so cheerful, happy, and encouraging that it just made it that much better.  I feel like I need a hefty dose of cheerful and encouraging in my life sometimes.  I also really liked that the two dancers working with him in this particular video were a healthy size (I can not say what they are like in any others from this production company, as this is the first one I\\'ve purchased), and one of them even appeared to be large framed like me.  And I like that they were more covered up.  I think all of those things are a very nice thing for a beginner to see, because if you are just starting out exercising, even if you want to be super petite and have lovely muscle definition, sometimes it can feel pretty intimidating to be confronted with in your face images of that right off the bat.\\n\\nI also like that the workout they include after the section that goes over the basic steps doesn\\'t add to many other movements, because from the learning perspective, repetition is actually the best way to get a movement down and it helps build confidence a lot better then if a bunch of new stuff that hadn\\'t been demonstrated were thrown in. And I managed to finish this video feeling more like a Latin dance cardio swan then a drunken duck this time, so I think I\\'m probably going to end up adopting Zumba for my dance cardio thing that I work in with my HIIT stuff.  I had a lot of fun doing this, more then I expected.  And my friend will probably say \"I told you so.\"  And I will just give her a hug for being right.',\n",

The clips make them easy to put on and take off. They are adjustable, which I like, since he will likely be skating for a while. The stoppers are good, the wheels don't get stuck on little rocks and pebbles like mine did when I was a kid. There is lots of ankle support and cushioning around the top. The inserts come out for washing and replacing. They are a bit heavy, so I wouldn't want to carry them far to start skating. We love them and use them inside on hardwood floors - no scratching - and out doors on sidewalks and at the park. They are great skates!\",\n",

The wheel arrived and appeared to be straight. After less than a mile test ride on pavement, it was out of true and out of dish. I went in and attempted to correct this when I discovered that everything else was improperly tensioned and thats why it was going off so easily. Went to try fixing that and had spoke nipples falling apart on me when I began tightening it (see photo). DO NOT BUY. Had I ridden much further, I would have been in serious danger from the wheel coming untensioned. These wheels are a safety hazard. Old review: There isn't too much I can say about these wheels, I didn't buy them to be ultra-light racers.  I bought them as good every-day riding wheels.  I've put several hundred miles on them already and have found them to be solid and true.  I do check them about once a week to once a month (depending on how much use they see) and often need to give them a slight tweak, but nothing out of the ordinary.  I also like the fact that the valve holes come with grommets to accept either presta or schrader valves.  I would buy these again if I needed more wheels.\\n\\nOne note, I checked both the truing and dishing when they arrived and both were fine.\",\n",

True not perfect out of the box (why not? they have a machine to do it) but a little tweaking on a truing stand got it done. If you do not have a truing stand, you would probably be good as is but still..... they have a machine.\\n\\nAs in other comments, the bearings are tight on arrival. Why? Anyway, you have to adjust them. That is easy for me because I have done this many times before. But for someone who has not, they won\\'t, and then I imagine the bearing would go pretty fast. Why aren\\'t they perfect on arrival?\\n\\nSo the wheel is great, high quality materials, not just \"good replacement for Schwinn crap\" I heard  something like in other reviews, but actually really nice and light and attractive looking wheels with SS spokes and sunken spoke holes to boot (keep their ends away from tube). No problem pulling Schrader valves through the holes. Because of the recessed spoke holes you probably to do not need \"rim tape\" to protect the tubes, but just to be safe just use some electrical tape. It works great.\\n\\nI will be using these for an every day commute. I will bet they are just fine for 100\\'s of miles but if not, I will revise this review.\\n\\n The review would have been 5 stars if the wheels had been perfectly true and with proper bearing tightness on arrival.\\n\\nHey \"Stay-Tru\", get this straight.

The way the device handles friction is such that a very, very large amount of the work on the belayer is unloaded onto the Grigri instead. With that said, pulling slack from the lead is much more tiresome than traditional belay devices due to this friction. However, the effort of this is offset by the ease at which the lead climber is allowed to descend via the very sensitive handle on the device. My only concern is the lifetime of the device and especially the plastic handle. Good buy, but it should be closer to $70. Patents are to blame for that.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'The GriGri is an outstanding belay device. I\\'ve used mine for a couple of years now, and it\\'s performed perfectly. Here are 5 things I think you should know before buying a GriGri:\\n\\n1. The diagrams on the device are very straight forward, but you need to take care when lacing it up with your rope. Friction goes one way on this device, so you need to get the rope going in the right direction.\\n2. Construction is sturdy. Yes there is some plastic in this device, but I\\'ve dropped mine several times and the outer shell is metal, taking the brunt of an impact. So it stands up well.\\n3. For basic belaying, you may find that this device adds some reassurance for the person on belay and the belayer. This is because it locks up more automatically than a standard belay tool.\\n4. Now, this may be controversial for some, I\\'m going to just put it out there that this can be used as a solo-belay tool when using a fixed top rope. This means threading it with the fixed point as the \"climber,\" which may seem counter intuitive at first. But I\\'ve done this many times for two years now, and the device works well as a solo-tool. Some may find this unorthodox, but it\\'s nice to have a belay device that LOCKS UP so you can be hands free.\\n5. The reason I\\'ve used this as a solo belay device is for jobs like roofing and tree work. So if you\\'re looking for a tool to keep you on your rope and tight, this one works well.\\n\\nOverall, I think you\\'ll agree that Petzl makes great climbing gear. I have several belay devices, but this is my go-to tool in many situations.',\n",

I've had some experience with the original, a few weeks with this, and none with the Trango Cinch or the like, so take my impressions for what they're worth.\\n\\nThe major reason you'd buy an assisted-locking device is for the extra safety margin. The Grigri has a locking cam that halts the rope when it pulls out at a certain speed. That's a tremendous boon where the belayer is inattentive or inexperienced, or where the belayer can't see the climber. It's also next to impossible to get the webbing of your brake hand stuck in it, as I've seen twice occur with sudden falls to ATCs in the last three months. And when your climber wants to hang, it's a lot easier to sit and chill when you don't need to keep constant heavy braking tension.\\n\\nRelative to the old Grigri, this one is significantly smaller and lighter. The old one could feel like an anchor if left on the harness for difficult climbs. This one, not so much. The friction lip is also a bit wider and easier to slot your fingers under, a helpful fulcrum if you're holding the cam down to feed rope. Inside, the rope grooves are sharper and tighter, which allows Petzl to officially support thinner ropes, but has some downstream implications I get into below.\\n\\nThe belay learning curve for top-roping is very short. For the initial feed of rope through the device, the Grigri is ingrained with clear directional diagrams. Taking rope is identical to what you'd do with an ATC.\\n\\nFeeding rope for lead climbs takes a bit more practice. Conventional belay technique has your brake hand on the rope at all times. You don't really modify that with the Grigri, but you may need to leave additional slack between the mechanism and your brake hand, and use a thumb from that hand to hold the locking cam down while you pull through. It is actually possible to feed rope very quickly without engaging the locking cam if both ends of the rope are vertical, but I found this method inconsistent. An advantage of manual-locking belay devices is that, when the lead climber falls, they allow the belayer to feed rope for a softer brake and a dynamic catch. This ability is negated by the Grigri's immediate cam engagement, though a lighter belayer may well lift off the ground, a dynamic catch in itself.\\n\\nDescending and letting down climbers is a novel experience. All of the original Grigris I've used have been very forgiving with the thick and fuzzy indoor ropes I've encountered. The Grigri 2, not so much. The difference between your climber inching and plummeting is about 10% pressure on the handle. I eventually grew adept at quick and controlled descents after about a dozen belays, but only by fixing my hand in place and using my shoulder to adjust the pressure. Fingers alone inevitably led to a quick drop, followed by my climber lifting me off the ground when I let off and the cam suddenly closed. While Petzl's literature implies that the friction lip should control the speed instead of the handle, I've found that careful manipulation of both is necessary. Also of note: with the original Grigri, you could press on the cam to lower a hanging climber without using the handle. For better or worse, that's no longer possible.\\n\\nOn balance though, unless I need the additional versatility of a conventional ATC, I always reach for a Grigri. I don't recommend it at the outset to novices because it can promote sloppy belay technique, but after you've been at it for a little while, it's a wonderful accessory. A simpler, cheaper, and slightly less foolproof alternative is Mammut's Smart Belay Device.\\n\\nADDENDUM: The very first copies of the Grigri 2 were recalled for a defective release handle. Any new copy is likely to be post-recall. Beware used copies from early 2011. The affected serial numbers are on Petzl's website.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"This and the original Grigri are the two most common assisted-locking belay devices. I've had some experience with the original, a few weeks with this, and none with the Trango Cinch or the like, so take my impressions for what they're worth.\\n\\nThe major reason you'd buy an assisted-locking device is for the extra safety margin. The Grigri has a locking cam that halts the rope when it pulls out at a certain speed. That's a tremendous boon where the belayer is inattentive or inexperienced, or where the belayer can't see the climber. It's also next to impossible to get the webbing of your brake hand stuck in it, as I've seen twice occur with sudden falls to ATCs in the last three months. And when your climber wants to hang, it's a lot easier to sit and chill when you don't need to keep constant heavy braking tension.\\n\\nRelative to the old Grigri, this one is significantly smaller and lighter. The old one could feel like an anchor if left on the harness for difficult climbs. This one, not so much. The friction lip is also a bit wider and easier to slot your fingers under, a helpful fulcrum if you're holding the cam down to feed rope. Inside, the rope grooves are sharper and tighter, which allows Petzl to officially support thinner ropes, but has some downstream implications I get into below.\\n\\nThe belay learning curve for top-roping is very short. For the initial feed of rope through the device, the Grigri is ingrained with clear directional diagrams. Taking rope is identical to what you'd do with an ATC.\\n\\nFeeding rope for lead climbs takes a bit more practice. Conventional belay technique has your brake hand on the rope at all times. You don't really modify that with the Grigri, but you may need to leave additional slack between the mechanism and your brake hand, and use a thumb from that hand to hold the locking cam down while you pull through. It is actually possible to feed rope very quickly without engaging the locking cam if both ends of the rope are vertical, but I found this method inconsistent. An advantage of manual-locking belay devices is that, when the lead climber falls, they allow the belayer to feed rope for a softer brake and a dynamic catch. This ability is negated by the Grigri's immediate cam engagement, though a lighter belayer may well lift off the ground, a dynamic catch in itself.\\n\\nDescending and letting down climbers is a novel experience. All of the original Grigris I've used have been very forgiving with the thick and fuzzy indoor ropes I've encountered. The Grigri 2, not so much. The difference between your climber inching and plummeting is about 10% pressure on the handle. I eventually grew adept at quick and controlled descents after about a dozen belays, but only by fixing my hand in place and using my shoulder to adjust the pressure. Fingers alone inevitably led to a quick drop, followed by my climber lifting me off the ground when I let off and the cam suddenly closed.

I've been wanting to get a tactile style vest for a while now so when I saw this was on sale I bought it.  Aside from its sporty sleek style (not bulky looking) it adjusts both length and girth. It is very comfortable and I was able to adjust it to my body quickly and easily and it stayed secured without slipping. This vest has numerous pouches that can hold up to two mags in each or snacks if your my wife. I like that the pouches have drain holes and elastic to hold thins securely in place. It also has a couple of large pouches that are located inside the vest which is for holding maps but you can utilize it for other purposes as well. This vest is well designed and built with heavy gauge zipper and mesh ventilation to keep you cooler.\",\n",

If you have the money and it is going to be something that you are going to use every day, spend the money and get a real rig. For those that want something simple to keep in the closet for that rainy day, or want to do some reload and draw drills with a side arm, this is perfect. Quality is awesome. The vest is really adjustable, and I love the fact that belt can be separated, put through your belt loops and reattached to the vest so that it properly holds your pants up. I lost so much wight on my deployments that my web belt wouldnt hold my pants up anymore, and this belt, is pretty awesome.\\n\\nI would totally buy this, and it fits perfectly over my plate carrier and SAPPI plates.\",\n",

My vest came with a total of six rifle mag pouches, four pistol mag pouches, a pouch that will hold six shotgun shells on the outside, and a radio pouch.\\n\\nThe vest is adjustable and fits my six foot frame with a 52' chest and 40 waist perfectly with room to spare.  The zipper and seams are well constructed and once adjusted it is very comfortable to wear even when fully loaded.  You can attach a dehydration pack to the back of the vest along with other equipment.  All-in-all I can not find anything negative about this vest\",\n",

But it is stiff at first i assume with time it will get better. I do wish it came with some pouches for the back, but you can talor it to your needs. I mean for the price it's a great buy. I don't know how it would hold up in a combat situation, but i think it would do ok. Only time will tell. It works fine for my sight class.
